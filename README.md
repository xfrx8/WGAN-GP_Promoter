# WGAN-GP for Promoter Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a **Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)** for the task of promoter prediction in genomic sequences. Promoters are DNA sequences that initiate the transcription of a particular gene, and accurately predicting their location is a crucial task in genomics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of WGAN-GP to generate synthetic promoter sequences and improve promoter prediction models. WGAN-GP is a variant of GAN that incorporates a gradient penalty to enforce the Lipschitz constraint, making the training more stable and the model more robust.

## Key Features

- **WGAN-GP Architecture**: The project implements the WGAN-GP model, which includes a generator and a discriminator network. The generator creates synthetic promoter sequences, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the sequences.

- **Gradient Penalty**: To address the instability issues commonly found in GANs, the project incorporates a gradient penalty in the loss function, ensuring smoother and more stable training dynamics.

- **Promoter Data**: The project utilizes genomic data, specifically promoter sequences, as the training dataset. The aim is to generate realistic promoter sequences that can help in improving predictive models.

- **Model Training**: The repository includes scripts for training the WGAN-GP model on the promoter dataset, with hyperparameters tuned for optimal performance.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your genomic promoter data in the required format.
   
2. **Training the Model**: Use the provided training script to train the WGAN-GP model on your dataset.

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path path_to_your_data
   ```

3. **Generating Promoter Sequences**: After training, you can use the generator to create synthetic promoter sequences.

   ```bash
   python generate.py --model_path path_to_trained_model
   ```

## Results

The generated sequences can be evaluated for their biological relevance, and the model's performance can be compared with traditional promoter prediction methods.
